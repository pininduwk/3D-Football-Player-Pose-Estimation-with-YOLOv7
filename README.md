# 3D-Football-Player-Pose-Estimation-with-YOLOv7

## Introduction

This project is a computer vision-based football post detection algorithm. It uses two computer vision models, YOLO V7 for post detection and regular object detection for tracking the ball. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how computer vision can be used in sports.
